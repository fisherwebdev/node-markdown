A Little About Me
=================

Hello!

My name is Bill Fisher and I'd like to welcome you to my corner of the Web.

Employment
----------

I'm a software engineer at Facebook in Menlo Park, California.  Prior to this, I worked for Hot Studio, a strategic design and development agency in San Francisco.

Code
----

JavaScript and Ruby are the languages I prefer for building web applications, but I also find myself deep in the land of CSS quite often.  I also like both relational and non-relational databases.

User Interfaces
---------------

I find that I gravitate toward new user interface paradigms, like touch screens or motion tracking.  To make the management of complex touch interfaces a little bit easier, I created [Touchy](http://touchyjs.org), a jQuery plugin for managing touch events.  I've also blogged and given presentations on the subject of touch screen interactions for the Web.  Recently, I also began working with the Leap Motion device and the leapjs API, which brings fine-motor gestural motion tracking to the Web.

Hobbies
-------

Lately I've enjoyed experimenting with functional programming in Haskell and playing around with both the Leap Motion device and my Raspberry Pi.  I also enjoy playing acoustic, electric and electronic music.

About This Site
---------------

Hand coded in Node.js, without Express, but with Connect and Jade.  I wanted to do this myself to experiment with Node.  I write the content in Markdown.  My package.json currently looks like this:

```json

  "subdomain": "fisherwebdev",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "server.js"
  },
