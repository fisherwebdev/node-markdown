A Little About Me
=================

Hello!

My name is Bill Fisher and I'd like to welcome you to my corner of the Web.

Employment
----------

I'm a software engineer currently working for Facebook.  Prior to this, I worked for Hot Studio, a strategic design and development agency in San Francisco.

Code
----

JavaScript and Ruby are the languages I prefer for building web applications, but I also find myself deep in the land of CSS quite often.  I also like both relational and non-relational databases.

User Interfaces
---------------

I also tend to gravitate toward interesting new user interface paradigms, like touch screens or motion tracking.  To make the management of complex touch interfaces a little bit easier, I created Touchy, a jQeury plugin for managing touch events.  I've also blogged and given presentations on the subject of touch screen interactions for the Web.  I recently also began working with the Leap Motion device and the leapjs API, which brings fine-motor gestural motion tracking to the Web.

Hobbies
-------

Lately, I've enjoyed experimenting with functional programming in Haskell and playing around with both the Leap Motion device and my Raspberry Pi.  I also enjoy playing acoustic, electric and electronic music.
