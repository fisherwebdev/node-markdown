Nginx on a Raspberry Pi
=======================

On my Mac, I like to drop files into the Sites folder, and then simply go to http://localhost to be able to see them.  I'd like to be able to do something similar on the Rasperry Pi.

I know there is a built-in Python server, but I'd rather use something more like what I'd use on a production website.  So I'm going to use Nginx, which is extremely fast and has a low memory footprint.
