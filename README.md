Node-Markdown
=============

A web server for markdown files, suitable for an extremely lightweight blog, or some other very small, static web project.

I did this project for fun and to learn a little about Node.js.

You probably don't want to clone and use this.  There are other, probably *much better* projects where Node, Markdown and blogging come together:
